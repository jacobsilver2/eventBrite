## Tech/Framework Used
This calendar uses jQuery, javascript and css. It fetches JSON data from Eventbrite, and formats it into an easy to read, professional looking calendar of events.  It features lazy loading, links to purchase tickets to individual events, and image zooming.  It contains default images that display at random for events which have no imaged associated with itself.  It also contains a good amount of date logic to handle all events which have already happened.
